# NLPL Ecosystem Development - Status Report

**Date**: January 28, 2026  
**Phase**: Graphics Foundation (Phase 1, Month 2)  
**Status**: In Progress 🚀

## Completed This Session

### ✅ 3D Math Library (Week 1 Complete)

**New Module**: `src/nlpl/stdlib/math3d/__init__.py` (~800 lines)

**Components**:
1. **Vector2** - 2D vector operations
   - Screen coordinates, texture coordinates
   - Operations: add, sub, mul, div, normalize, dot, lerp
   - Length, distance calculations

2. **Vector3** - 3D vector operations
   - Positions, directions, normals
   - Operations: add, sub, mul, div, cross, dot, normalize
   - Reflection, projection, angle calculations
   - Constants: zero, one, up, down, forward, back, right, left

3. **Matrix4** - 4x4 transformation matrices
   - Translation, rotation (X/Y/Z), scale
   - Perspective & orthographic projection
   - Camera transformations (look_at)
   - Matrix multiplication, transpose, determinant
   - Transform points and directions

4. **Quaternion** - 3D rotations (avoids gimbal lock)
   - Axis-angle construction
   - Euler angle conversion
   - SLERP interpolation (smooth rotation)
   - Vector rotation
   - Matrix conversion

**Integration**:
- ✅ Registered 60+ functions with NLPL runtime
- ✅ Added to stdlib module list
- ✅ Example demo created: `examples/engine_demos/01_math3d_demo.nlpl`
- ✅ Documentation: `examples/engine_demos/README.md`

**Testing Status**: Functions registered, demo created (interpreter test pending)

---

## Why This Matters

The 3D math library is the **foundation** for everything that follows:
- Graphics rendering requires matrix transformations
- Physics needs vector calculations  
- Animation uses quaternion interpolation
- Camera systems depend on look_at matrices

**No 3D engine can exist without these primitives.** ✅

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Test the math library** in interpreter mode
2. **Fix any bugs** discovered during testing
3. **Add unit tests** for critical operations (dot product, matrix multiplication, SLERP)

### Week 2-4 (February 2026)
4. **OpenGL enhancement** - Improve existing `graphics/__init__.py`
   - VAO/VBO management
   - Shader compilation and linking
   - Texture loading
   - Basic mesh rendering

5. **Camera system** - Use Matrix4 for view/projection
   - FPS camera controls
   - Orbital camera
   - Camera demo: `examples/engine_demos/02_camera_demo.nlpl`

### Week 5-6 (March 2026)
6. **Mesh data structures** - Prepare for model loading
   - Vertex format (position, normal, UV)
   - Index buffers
   - Simple primitives (cube, sphere, plane)

7. **Rendering demo** - Put it all together
   - Rotating cube with camera controls
   - `examples/engine_demos/03_rotating_cube.nlpl`

## Roadmap Reference

See `docs/8_planning/ECOSYSTEM_ROADMAP_2026.md` for the full 12-month plan.

**Current Position**: Month 2, Week 1 of Phase 1 (Graphics Foundation)

**Target Completion**: 
- Phase 1: April 2026
- Full 3D Engine: January 2027

## Technical Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Python Implementation First**
   - Faster iteration during development
   - Easy to debug and test
   - Can move to C/LLVM later for performance

2. **Row-Major Matrices**
   - Matches OpenGL/Vulkan conventions
   - [m00, m01, m02, m03, m10, m11, ...]

3. **Right-Handed Coordinate System**
   - +Y is up, +Z is forward, +X is right
   - Standard for OpenGL

4. **Quaternions Over Euler**
   - No gimbal lock
   - Smoother interpolation (SLERP)
   - More compact rotation representation

### Performance Considerations

- Critical operations (matrix multiply, normalize) can be JIT-compiled later
- For now, Python performance is sufficient for prototyping
- Future: Move hot paths to C or compile to LLVM

---

## Dependencies

**Current**: None (pure Python math)  
**Future**: 
- OpenGL/Vulkan libraries (system dependencies)
- GLFW or SDL2 (windowing)
- PyOpenGL (for Python-based testing)

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **Math library created** (~800 lines)  
✅ **60+ functions registered**  
✅ **Demo program written**  
⏳ **Interpreter test** (pending)  
⏳ **Unit tests** (pending)  
⏳ **First rendered triangle** (future milestone)

---

## Conclusion

**The journey from language to ecosystem has begun.** 

The 3D math library is the first building block. It's small (800 lines), foundational (everything depends on it), and complete (all core operations implemented).

Next up: OpenGL rendering and camera systems. By end of February, we'll have a **rotating 3D cube** rendered in NLPL. 🎯
