# NLPL Syntax Reference

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026  
**Language Version:** Pre-1.0 (Release Candidate)

---

## Overview

NLPL (Natural Language Programming Language) uses English-like syntax that reads like prose while maintaining programming precision. This guide covers all major syntax features.

**Design Principles:**
- Natural language keywords (`set`, `to`, `with`, `called`, `function`)
- Explicit statement boundaries (`end` keyword)
- Type annotations optional but encouraged
- Whitespace-insensitive (except newlines)
- Case-sensitive identifiers

## Variables

### Declaration and Assignment

```nlpl
# Basic variable declaration
set name to "Alice"
set age to 25
set height to 5.9
set is_student to true

# With type annotations
set count to 0 as Integer
set price to 19.99 as Float
set message to "Hello" as String

# Multiple assignments
set x to 10
set y to 20
set z to x plus y
```

### Variable Naming Rules

- Start with letter or underscore
- Contain letters, digits, underscores
- Case-sensitive (`myVar` ≠ `MyVar`)
- Cannot be keywords (`set`, `function`, `class`, etc.)

**Conventions:**
- Variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `user_name`, `total_count`)
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_SIZE`, `PI`)
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserAccount`, `FileSystem`)
- Functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `calculate_total`, `get_user`)

end

# Function with parameters
function greet_person with name as String
  print text "Hello, " plus name
end

# Function with return value

# With parameters
call greet_person with "Alice"

# With return value
set sum to add with 5, 10
set area to calculate_area with 10.0, 20.0
```

### Lambda Expressions

# Lambda with multiple parameters
set add to lambda a, b returns a plus b

# Using lambdas
set result to double with 5  # result = 10
set sum to add with 3, 7     # sum = 10
```

else if score is greater than or equal to 80
  set grade to "B"
else if score is greater than or equal to 70
  set grade to "C"
else
  set grade to "F"
end
```

### Comparison Operators

```nlpl
# Natural language comparisons
if x equals y              # x == y
if x is equal to y         # x == y
if x is not equal to y     # x != y
if x is greater than y     # x > y
if x is less than y        # x < y
if x is greater than or equal to y  # x >= y
if x is less than or equal to y     # x <= y
```

### Loops

```nlpl
# While loop
while count is less than 10
  print text count
  set count to count plus 1
end

# For each loop
for each item in items
  print text item
end

# Repeat loop
repeat 5 times
  print text "Hello"
end

# Repeat with condition
repeat while counter is less than 100
  set counter to counter plus 10
end

# Break and continue
while true
  if condition1
    break      # Exit loop
  end
  if condition2
    continue   # Skip to next iteration
  end
end
```

### Switch Statement

### Basic Pattern Matching

```nlpl
match value with
  case 0 then "zero"
  case 1 then "one"
  case n then "other: " plus (n to_string)
end
```

### With Guards

```nlpl
match age with
  case n if n is less than 0 then "invalid"
  case n if n is less than 13 then "child"
  case n if n is less than 20 then "teenager"
  case n if n is less than 65 then "adult"
  case n then "senior"
end
```

### List Destructuring

```nlpl
match numbers with
  case [] then "empty"
  case [x] then "single element"
  case [x, y] then "pair"
  case [head, tail...] then "list starting with " plus (head to_string)
end
```

### Option/Result Matching

```nlpl
match result with
  case Ok(value) then print text "Success: " plus (value to_string)
  case Err(msg) then print text "Error: " plus msg
end
```

  print text "Validation failed: " plus e.message
catch e
  print text "Other error: " plus e
end
```

---

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

```nlpl
set sum to a plus b           # Addition
set diff to a minus b         # Subtraction
set product to a times b      # Multiplication
set quotient to a divided by b # Division
set remainder to a modulo b   # Modulus
set power to a to the power of b # Exponentiation
```

### Comparison Operators

```nlpl
a equals b                    # Equal
a is equal to b               # Equal
a is not equal to b           # Not equal
a is greater than b           # Greater than
a is less than b              # Less than
a is greater than or equal to b # Greater or equal
a is less than or equal to b    # Less or equal
```

### Logical Operators

```nlpl
condition1 and condition2     # Logical AND
condition1 or condition2      # Logical OR
not condition                 # Logical NOT
```

### String Operations

```nlpl
set greeting to "Hello" plus " " plus "World"  # Concatenation
set length to length of "Hello"                # Length
set upper to upper of "hello"                  # Uppercase
set lower to lower of "HELLO"                  # Lowercase
set substring to substring of "Hello" from 1 to 4 # Substring
```

### List Operations

```nlpl
# Access element
set first to items[0]

# Modify element
set items[1] to "new value"

# Length
set count to length of items

# Append
append "item" to items

# Remove
remove "item" from items
```

### Dictionary Operations

```nlpl
# Access value
set value to dict["key"]

# Set value
set dict["key"] to "value"

# Check key existence
if "key" in dict
  print text "Key exists"
end

# Remove key
remove "key" from dict
```

---

## Comments

```nlpl
# Single-line comment

# Multi-line comment
# across multiple lines
# using # at the start of each line

set x to 10  # Inline comment
```

---

## Type Annotations

### Variable Type Annotations

```nlpl
set name to "Alice" as String
set age to 25 as Integer
set scores to [90, 85, 92] as List of Integer
set user to {"name": "Alice"} as Dictionary of String to String
```

### Function Type Annotations

```nlpl
function process with items as List of Integer, threshold as Float returns Boolean
  # Function body
  return true
end
```

### Generic Type Annotations

```nlpl
function find with haystack as List of T, needle as T returns Option of Integer
  # Generic function
end
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Names

```nlpl
# Good
function calculate_total_price with items as List of Product returns Float

# Bad
function calc with x as List returns Float
```

### 2. Add Type Annotations

```nlpl
# Good - clear types
function process_user with user as User, action as String returns Result of User, String

# Acceptable - types inferred
function add with a, b
  return a plus b
end
```

### 3. Use Pattern Matching Over If/Else

```nlpl
# Good - clear and exhaustive
match status with
  case "pending" then handle_pending
  case "active" then handle_active
  case "complete" then handle_complete
  case _ then handle_unknown
end

# Acceptable but less clear
if status equals "pending"
  handle_pending
else if status equals "active"
  handle_active
# ...
```

### 4. Handle Errors Explicitly

```nlpl
# Good
try
  set result to risky_operation
  return Ok(result)
catch error
  log_error with error
  return Err(error)
end

# Bad - ignores errors
set result to risky_operation
```

### 5. Use Const for Immutable Values

```nlpl
const PI to 3.14159
const MAX_USERS to 1000
const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT to 30
```
