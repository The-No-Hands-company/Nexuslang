# NLPL Multi-Level Examples

**Demonstrating the Same Programs at All Five Abstraction Levels**

---

## Overview

This document shows how the **same functionality** can be implemented at different abstraction levels in NLPL. Each level trades control for convenience, but **all compile to the same performant native code**.

---

## Example 1: HTTP Web Server

### Requirements
- Listen on port 8080
- Handle GET requests to `/hello`
- Return "Hello, World!"
- Handle 10,000 concurrent connections

---

### Level 5: Natural Language

**Lines of Code:** ~10 
**Capable of:** Prototyping, scripts, rapid development

```nlpl
# Create a simple web server
create a web server on port 8080

when someone visits "/hello"
 say hello to them with "Hello, World!"
end

when someone visits the home page
 show them a welcome message
end

start listening for requests
tell me when it's running
```

**Pros:**
- Extremely readable
- No technical knowledge needed
- Perfect for prototypes

**Cons:**
- Limited control
- Ambiguity possible
- Not for performance tuning

---

### Level 4: Goroutines (High-Level)

**Lines of Code:** ~20 
**Capable of:** Production web services, APIs, microservices

```nlpl
import from stdlib/http

function start_server
 # Create HTTP server
 set server to create http server on port 8080
 
 # Define routes with automatic concurrency
 server.on "GET /hello" do with request
 spawn
 # Each request handled in its own goroutine
 # Automatically scales to 10,000+ concurrent connections
 return new response with 200, "Hello, World!"
 end
 end
 
 server.on "GET /" do with request
 spawn
 set welcome to "Welcome to NLPL server!"
 return new response with 200, welcome
 end
 end
 
 # Start listening (non-blocking)
 print text "Server running on port 8080"
 server.listen
end

# Run server
start_server
```

**Pros:**
- 10,000+ concurrent connections easily
- Automatic goroutine management
- Clean, readable code
- Production-ready

**Cons:**
- Less control over scheduling
- Some abstraction overhead

---

### Level 3: Application Programming

**Lines of Code:** ~40 
**Capable of:** Desktop apps, custom servers, applications with specific requirements

```nlpl
import from stdlib/net
import from stdlib/threading

class HttpServer
 property socket as ServerSocket
 property thread_pool as ThreadPool
 
 function initialize with port as Integer
 set socket to create tcp server socket on port
 set thread_pool to create thread pool with 16 threads
 end
 
 function handle_connection with client as ClientSocket
 # Parse HTTP request
 set request_line to client.read_line
 set parts to request_line.split with " "
 set method to parts[0]
 set path to parts[1]
 
 # Route handling
 if path equals "/hello"
 set response to "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 13\r\n\r\nHello, World!"
 client.write with response
 otherwise if path equals "/"
 set response to "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 25\r\n\r\nWelcome to NLPL server!"
 client.write with response
 otherwise
 set response to "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n"
 client.write with response
 end
 
 client.close
 end
 
 function start
 print text "Server running on port 8080"
 
 while true
 set client to socket.accept
 
 # Submit to thread pool
 thread_pool.submit with lambda: handle_connection with client
 end
 end
end

# Create and start server
set server to new HttpServer with 8080
server.start
```

**Pros:**
- Explicit thread control
- Custom error handling
- Fine-tune performance
- Structured code

**Cons:**
- More verbose
- Manual thread pool management
- More complex than Level 4

---

### Level 2: Systems Programming

**Lines of Code:** ~80 
**Capable of:** High-performance servers, embedded systems, performance-critical applications

```nlpl

 otherwise if request contains "/ "
 set response to "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 25\r\n\r\nWelcome to NLPL server!"
 otherwise
 set response to "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n"
 end
 
 # Write response
 call write with client_fd, response as Pointer, response.length
 
 # Cleanup

 # Bind
 call bind with sockfd, address of addr as Pointer, sizeof sockaddr_in
 
 # Listen

 print text "Server running on port ", port
 
 # Accept loop
 while true
 set client_fd to call accept with sockfd, null, null
 
 # Allocate client_fd for thread
 set client_fd_ptr to allocate with sizeof Integer
 write client_fd to client_fd_ptr
 
 # Create thread for each connection
 set thread as Integer
 call pthread_create with address of thread, null, address of handle_client, client_fd_ptr
 call pthread_detach with thread
 end
end

# Start server
start_server with 8080
```

**Pros:**
- Maximum performance

- Minimal overhead
- Portable to embedded systems

**Cons:**
- Very verbose

 xor rsi, rsi # NULL addr
 xor rdx, rdx # NULL addrlen
 syscall
 end
end

 inline assembly
 mov rax, 0 # SYS_READ
 mov rdi, [fd]
 mov rsi, [buf]
 mov rdx, [count]
 syscall

 # Allocate 4KB stack buffer
 set buffer_size to 4096
 inline assembly
 sub rsp, 4096 # Allocate on stack
 mov rbx, rsp # Buffer pointer in RBX
 end
 
 # Read request
 set bytes_read to syscall_read with client_fd, @rbx, buffer_size
 
 # Simple path check (assembly string comparison)
 # ... (omitted for brevity, would be ~50 lines of assembly)
 
 # Write response

 set response_len to 54

 # Create socket
 set sockfd to syscall_socket
 
 # Setup sockaddr_in on stack
 inline assembly
 sub rsp, 16 # sizeof(sockaddr_in)
 mov word ptr [rsp], 2 # AF_INET
 mov ax, [port]
 xchg al, ah # htons
 mov word ptr [rsp+2], ax
 mov dword ptr [rsp+4], 0 # INADDR_ANY
 mov rsi, rsp # addr pointer
 end
 
 # Bind
 syscall_bind with sockfd, @rsi, 16
 
 # Listen
 syscall_listen with sockfd, 128
 
 # Accept loop
 while true
 set client_fd to syscall_accept with sockfd
 
 # For simplicity, handle inline (no threading at this level)
 handle_client with client_fd
 end
end

# Start
start_server with 8080
```

**Pros:**
- Absolute maximum control
- Zero runtime overhead
- Direct syscalls
- Well-suited to system programming

**Cons:**
- Extremely verbose
- Architecture-specific
- Very error-prone
- Not portable

## Example 3: Operating System Kernel (Boot Sequence)

This example shows how **Level 1** enables OS development.

### Level 1: Assembly-Level Kernel Boot

```nlpl
# Bootloader entry point (called by BIOS/UEFI)
function _start
 # Disable interrupts during init
 inline assembly

 end
 
 # Setup stack
 inline assembly
 mov esp, 0x9F000 # Stack at 640KB

 end
 
 # Jump to kernel main

 # Halt if kernel returns
 inline assembly

 # Reload segment registers
 mov ax, 0x10 # Data segment selector
 mov ds, ax
 mov es, ax
 mov fs, ax
 mov gs, ax
 mov ss, ax
 
 # Far jump to reload CS
 jmp 0x08:flush_cs
 flush_cs:
 end
end

# Setup Interrupt Descriptor Table
function setup_idt
 # Write interrupt handlers
 set idt_base to 0x0000 as Pointer
 
 # Install handlers (assembly)

end
```

**This Level 1 code:**
- Boots on bare metal (no OS)
- Sets up CPU protection features
- Handles interrupts
- Manages memory directly
- **Written in readable English-like syntax!**

**No other language** can do this with readable syntax.
