# NLPL Type System Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a static type system for the NLPL language. This type system provides compile-time type checking to catch type errors before program execution, enhancing the robustness and reliability of NLPL programs.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Type Definitions

- **Base Type Class**: A foundational class for all types with methods for compatibility checks
- **Primitive Types**: Integer, Float, String, Boolean, Null
- **Complex Types**: List, Dictionary, Function, Union, Any
- **Type Registry**: A central registry for common types and type lookup by name

### 2. Type Checking

- **Type Environment**: Manages variable and function types in different scopes
- **Type Checker**: Analyzes AST nodes and verifies type compatibility
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages for type violations

### 3. Parser Integration

- **Type Annotation Syntax**: Updated the parser to support type annotations
- **Variable Declarations**: `Create <identifier> as <type> and set it to <expression>`
- **Function Definitions**: `Define a function called <name> that takes <params> and returns <type>`
- **Parameter Declarations**: `<param_name> as <type>`

### 4. Interpreter Integration

- **TypedInterpreter**: A wrapper around the standard interpreter that performs type checking
- **Integration with Runtime**: Seamless connection with the existing runtime system
- **Command-line Options**: Added `--no-type-check` flag to disable type checking when needed

## Type Checking Rules

### Assignment Compatibility

- Values can only be assigned to variables of compatible types
- Subtype relationships are respected (e.g., Integer is compatible with Float)
- Null is compatible with all types

### Function Call Compatibility

- Arguments must match parameter types
- Return values must match the declared return type
- Function overloading is not supported (yet)

### Operator Compatibility

- Binary operations check operand types
- Special handling for string concatenation with '+'
- Comparison operators enforce numeric types for '<', '>', etc.

## Example Usage

```
# Variable declarations with type annotations
Create count as Integer and set it to 10.
Create name as String and set it to "NLPL".

# Function with type annotations
Define a function called calculate_total that takes quantity as Integer, price as Float and returns Float
    Return quantity * price.
End function.

# Using the function
Create total as Float and set it to calculate_total(count, 19.99).
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Type Inference**: Automatically determine types without explicit annotations
2. **Generic Types**: Support for parameterized types like `List<T>`
3. **User-defined Types**: Integration with class definitions
4. **Type Aliases**: Allow users to define custom type names
5. **Union Types**: Explicit support for variables that can hold multiple types
6. **Nullable Types**: Explicit handling of potentially null values

## Conclusion

The type system implementation significantly enhances the NLPL language by providing static type safety. This helps catch errors early in the development process and improves code reliability. The design is flexible enough to support future extensions while maintaining compatibility with the existing language features.
