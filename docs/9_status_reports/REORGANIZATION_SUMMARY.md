# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date:** November 20, 2025 
**Status:** Complete

## What Changed

All documentation files have been organized from a flat structure into **10 logical categories** for improved navigation and maintainability.

## New Structure

```
docs/
 README.md [NEW] Main documentation index
 _ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md [NEW] Folder structure guide
 1_introduction/ [4 files] Getting started
 2_language_basics/ [4 files] Syntax fundamentals
 3_core_concepts/ [7 files] Advanced features
 4_architecture/ [4 files] Compiler design
 5_type_system/ [3 files] Type system
 6_module_system/ [3 files] Modules & imports
 7_development/ [3 files] Developer resources
 8_planning/ [4 files] Roadmaps & requirements
 9_status_reports/ [5 files] Progress tracking
 10_assessments/ [5 files] Analysis & comparisons
 Creating a Truly Natural.../ [ARCHIVE] Historical docs
```

**Total:** 42 organized files + 2 new guides = 44 active documents

## Files Moved

### 6_module_system/ (Modules)
- `module_system.md`
- `module_system_summary.md`
- `module_system_enhancements.md`

### 7_development/ (Developer Guides)
- `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
- `style_guide.md`
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md`

### 8_planning/ (Project Planning)

- `examples_and_comparisons.md`

## New Documents Created

1. **`README.md`** - Main documentation index with:
 - Quick navigation to all 10 categories
 - Quick start guide for different user types
 - Current project status (15,394 LOC, 320 tests, 67% passing)
 - Key documents by audience (newcomers, developers, contributors, researchers)

2. **`_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed folder structure guide:
 - Folder purpose explanations
 - Complete file categorization
 - Organization principles

## Benefits

### Before (Flat Structure)
- 27 files scattered in root directory
- Hard to find specific topics
- No clear navigation path
- Difficult to maintain

### After (Organized Structure)
- 10 logical categories
- Easy topic discovery (e.g., all type system docs in `5_type_system/`)
- Clear navigation with README index
- Scalable structure (easy to add new docs)
- Audience-specific paths (newcomers 1,2,3; developers 4,5,6,7; researchers 10)

## How to Use

### For New Contributors
1. Read `README.md` for overview
2. Check `1_introduction/philosophy.md` to understand vision
3. Follow `7_development/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` to set up

### For Feature Development
1. Check `8_planning/current_priorities.md` for what to work on
2. Refer to relevant architecture docs in `4_architecture/`
3. Update `9_status_reports/` when completing milestones

### For Documentation Updates
1. Consult `_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` to find correct folder
2. Follow naming conventions (see guide)
3. Update `README.md` if adding major new sections

## Archive Folder

The `Creating a Truly Natural Language Programming Language/` folder contains:
- Historical/duplicated documents
- Early planning materials
- Reference for comparison with current state
- **NOT FOR ACTIVE USE** - kept for historical reference only

## Next Steps

- [ ] Update internal links in moved documents to reflect new paths
- [ ] Add cross-references between related documents
- [ ] Create topic-specific indexes (e.g., `4_architecture/INDEX.md`)
- [ ] Add badges to README (build status, test coverage, etc.)

**All documentation is now properly organized and indexed!**
