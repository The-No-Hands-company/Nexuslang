function load_csv with path as String returns List
    set lines to io.read_lines with path
    set header to io.split with lines[0] and delimiter: ","
    set records to []

    while i is less than length(lines)
        if length(lines[i]) is greater than 0
            set values to io.split with lines[i] and delimiter: ","
            set record to {}
            set j to 0
            while j is less than length(header)
                set record[header[j]] to values[j]
                set j to j plus 1
            append record to records
        set i to i plus 1
    return records
end

set rows to load_csv with "sales.csv"
