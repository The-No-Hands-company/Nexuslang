## Remaining Development Areas

### Priority #1: **Error Handling & Safety** (RECOMMENDED)
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 hours 
**Impact:** 

**What to Build:**

1. **Result<T, E> Type**
 ```nlpl
 function parse_int that takes str as String returns Result of Integer or Error
 # Try to parse
 if parsing_failed
 return Error with "Invalid number format"
 return Ok with parsed_value
 
 # Usage
 set result to parse_int with "123"
 match result with
 case Ok value
 print text value
 case Error message
 print text message
 ```

2. **Panic Recovery & Stack Unwinding**
 - Graceful error handling
 - Stack unwinding on panic
 - Error propagation (`?` operator)
 - Custom panic handlers

3. **Null Safety**
 - Non-nullable types by default
 - Explicit `Optional<T>` for nullables
 - Compiler warnings for unsafe operations
 - Safe unwrapping patterns

4. **Basic Ownership Tracking**
 - Track variable ownership
 - Prevent use-after-free
 - Simple lifetime analysis
 - Move semantics

**Benefits:**
- Production-ready safety
- Fewer runtime errors
- Better error messages
- Memory safety guarantees

---

### Priority #2: **FFI & Interop** (HIGH VALUE)
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours 
**Impact:** 

**What to Build:**

1. **C Foreign Function Interface**
 ```nlpl
 # Declare external C function
 extern function printf that takes format as String, args as VarArgs returns Integer
 extern function malloc that takes size as Integer returns Pointer
 extern function free that takes ptr as Pointer
 
 # Call C functions
 set memory to malloc with 1024
 printf with "Allocated %d bytes\n", 1024
 free with memory
 ```

2. **Library Linking**
 - Link against system libraries (`-lm`, `-lpthread`)
 - Custom library paths
 - Static/dynamic linking options
 - Automatic library discovery

3. **C Header Generation**
 ```nlpl
 # Export NLPL function to C
 export function calculate that takes x as Integer returns Integer
 return x times 2
 
 # Generates calculate.h:
 # int calculate(int x);
 ```

4. **Platform Detection**
 ```nlpl
 if platform is "linux"
 import linux_module
 else if platform is "windows"
 import windows_module
 else if platform is "macos"
 import macos_module
 ```

**Benefits:**
- Use existing C libraries
- Cross-platform support
- System programming capabilities
- Access to mature ecosystems

---

### Priority #3: **Advanced Language Features**
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours 
**Impact:** 

**What to Build:**

1. **Pattern Matching**
 ```nlpl
 match status with
 case Ok value
 print text value
 case Error message if message contains "timeout"
 print text "Connection timeout"
 case Error message
 print text message
 case _
 print text "Unknown status"
 ```

2. **Lambda/Anonymous Functions**
 ```nlpl
 set square to lambda that takes x returns x times x
 set doubled to map with numbers, lambda that takes n returns n times 2
 ```

3. **Traits/Interfaces** (Advanced)
 ```nlpl
 trait Drawable
 function draw that takes canvas as Canvas
 function get_bounds returns Rectangle
 
 class Circle implements Drawable
 property radius as Float
 
 function draw that takes canvas as Canvas
 canvas.draw_circle with radius
 
 function get_bounds returns Rectangle
 return Rectangle.new with radius times 2, radius times 2
 ```

4. **Async/Await**
 ```nlpl
 async function fetch_data that takes url as String returns Data
 set response to await http_get with url
 set parsed to await parse_json with response
 return parsed
 
 # Usage
 set data to await fetch_data with "https://api.example.com/data"
 ```

**Benefits:**
- More expressive code
- Modern programming patterns
- Competitive with mainstream languages

---

### Priority #4: **Tooling & Developer Experience**
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 hours 
**Impact:** 

**What to Build:**

1. **Enhanced Error Messages**
 - Colorized terminal output
 - Multi-line context (show 3-5 lines)
 - Inline suggestions and fix-its
 - Error codes with documentation links

2. **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**
 - Auto-completion
 - Go-to-definition
 - Hover documentation
 - Real-time diagnostics
 - Rename refactoring

3. **Debugger Integration**
 - DWARF debug info generation
 - GDB/LLDB support
 - Breakpoint support
 - Variable inspection
 - Stack trace navigation

4. **Build System**
 ```toml
 # nlpl.toml
 [package]
 name = "my-project"
 version = "1.0.0"
 
 [dependencies]
 http = "1.2.0"
 json = "2.1.0"
 
 [build]
 optimization = 2
 target = "native"
 ```

**Benefits:**
- Professional development experience
- Editor integration (VS Code, Vim, etc.)
- Easier debugging
- Faster development cycle

## My Recommendation: Error Handling & Safety

**Why Error Handling Next?**

1. **Foundation for Everything Else**
 - FFI needs safe error handling
 - Advanced features need Result<T,E>
 - Tooling needs good error reporting

2. **Production Readiness**
 - Currently: Panics crash the program
 - With error handling: Graceful recovery
 - Makes NLPL viable for real applications

3. **Perfect Timing**
 - Optimization system is complete
 - Generics system supports `Result<T,E>`
 - All core features are in place

4. **High Impact, Medium Effort**
 - 3-5 hours to implement
 - Massive improvement in safety
 - Unlocks production use cases

5. **Natural Language Advantage**
 - `return Error with "message"` is clear
 - `match result with case Ok/Error` is readable
 - NLPL's syntax makes error handling intuitive

## Error Handling Implementation Plan

If we choose error handling:

### Phase 1: Result<T, E> Type (1.5 hours)
- Generic Result type with Ok/Err variants
- Pattern matching support
- Result propagation (`?` operator)
- Conversion utilities

### Phase 2: Panic System (1 hour)
- Panic message formatting
- Stack unwinding
- Custom panic handlers
- Panic recovery boundaries

### Phase 3: Null Safety (1 hour)
- Non-nullable type annotations
- Optional<T> enforcement
- Safe unwrapping operators
- Compiler null-check warnings

### Phase 4: Ownership Basics (1.5 hours)
- Move semantics tracking
- Borrow checker (basic)
- Use-after-move detection
- Lifetime annotations (simple)

**Total: ~5 hours** for production-ready error handling
