# NLPL Multi-Level Implementation Roadmap

**Version:** 2.0 
**Date:** January 2, 2026 
**Target Completion:** December 2026

---

## Vision Statement

Implement **all five abstraction levels** in NLPL, creating the world's first language that truly spans from assembly to natural English, all with native performance.

---

## Current Status (January 2026)

| Level | Name | Status | Completion | Priority |
|-------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Level 1** | Assembly-Level | 20% | Inline ASM pending | High |
| **Level 2** | Systems Programming | 95% | Nearly complete | Done |
| **Level 3** | Application Programming | 100% | Complete | Done |
| **Level 4** | High-Level Abstractions | 10% | Goroutines pending | High |
| **Level 5** | Natural Language | 5% | Future phase | Medium |

**Overall Progress:** ~46% (weighted by implementation complexity)

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Level 3 & 2 Foundations COMPLETE
**Timeline:** Q3-Q4 2024 (Already done!) 
**Status:** 100% Complete

#### Achievements
- Full LLVM backend (9,594 lines)
- Object-oriented programming
