## Basic FFI Usage

### Declaring External Functions

```nlpl
# Basic external function
extern function printf with format as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

# Multiple parameters
extern function strcmp with str1 as Pointer with str2 as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

# Different calling conventions
foreign function WinAPI_Call with handle as Integer returns Integer from library "kernel32" calling convention stdcall

# No return value
extern function exit with code as Integer returns nothing from library "c"
```

### Declaring External Variables

```nlpl
# External global variable
extern variable errno as Integer from library "c"
extern variable stdin as Pointer from library "c"
```

### Calling External Functions

```nlpl
# Simple call
printf("Hello, World!\n")

# With variables
set msg to "Value: %d\n"
set value to 42
printf(msg, value)

# Storing result
set length to strlen("Hello")
set comparison to strcmp("apple", "banana")
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Memory Allocation

```nlpl
extern function malloc with size as Integer returns Pointer from library "c"
extern function free with ptr as Pointer from library "c"

function allocate_buffer with size as Integer returns Pointer
 set buffer to malloc(size)
 
 if buffer is null
 print text "Memory allocation failed!"
 return null
 end
 
 return buffer
end

function cleanup with buffer as Pointer
 if buffer is not null
 free(buffer)
 end
end
```

### Pattern 2: String Operations

```nlpl
extern function strlen with str as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"
extern function strcpy with dest as Pointer with src as Pointer returns Pointer from library "c"
extern function malloc with size as Integer returns Pointer from library "c"

function duplicate_string with original as String returns String
 set len to strlen(original)
 set copy to malloc(len plus 1) # +1 for null terminator
 
 if copy is not null
 strcpy(copy, original)
 end
 
 return copy
end
```

### Pattern 3: Math Operations

```nlpl
extern function sqrt with x as Float returns Float from library "m"
extern function pow with base as Float with exponent as Float returns Float from library "m"

function distance with x1 as Float with y1 as Float with x2 as Float with y2 as Float returns Float
 set dx to x2 minus x1
 set dy to y2 minus y1
 set dx_squared to pow(dx, 2.0)
 set dy_squared to pow(dy, 2.0)
 set sum to dx_squared plus dy_squared
 return sqrt(sum)
end
```

### Pattern 4: File Operations

```nlpl
extern function fopen with filename as Pointer with mode as Pointer returns Pointer from library "c"
extern function fclose with stream as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"
extern function fprintf with stream as Pointer with format as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

function write_to_file with filename as String with content as String
 set file to fopen(filename, "w")
 
 if file is not null
 fprintf(file, "%s", content)
 fclose(file)
 return true
 end
 
 return false
end
```

## Platform-Specific Libraries

### Linux/Unix Libraries

```nlpl

extern function pthread_create with thread as Pointer with attr as Pointer with start_routine as Pointer with arg as Pointer returns Integer from library "pthread"

# Dynamic linking
extern function dlopen with filename as Pointer with flag as Integer returns Pointer from library "dl"
extern function dlsym with handle as Pointer with symbol as Pointer returns Pointer from library "dl"
extern function dlclose with handle as Pointer returns Integer from library "dl"

## Error Handling

### Checking Return Values

```nlpl
extern function malloc with size as Integer returns Pointer from library "c"
extern function printf with format as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

function safe_malloc with size as Integer returns Pointer
 set buffer to malloc(size)
 
 if buffer is null
 printf("ERROR: malloc failed for %d bytes\n", size)
 # Handle error (exit, throw, return error code, etc.)
 end
 
 return buffer
end
```

### Using errno

```nlpl
extern variable errno as Integer from library "c"
extern function strerror with errnum as Integer returns Pointer from library "c"
extern function printf with format as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

function print_error
 set error_code to errno
 set error_msg to strerror(error_code)
 printf("Error %d: %s\n", error_code, error_msg)
end
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Pointers
```nlpl
set buffer to malloc(1024)
if buffer is null
 # Handle error
 return error
end
# ... use buffer ...
free(buffer)
```

### 2. Match Allocation with Deallocation
```nlpl
# Good: Free what you allocate
set data to malloc(100)
# ... use data ...
free(data)

# Bad: Memory leak
set data to malloc(100)
# ... forgot to free!
```

### 3. Use Correct Types
```nlpl
# Good: Correct type mapping
extern function strlen with str as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

# Bad: Wrong return type
extern function strlen with str as Pointer returns Float from library "c" # WRONG!
```

### 4. Specify Libraries Correctly
```nlpl
# Good: Explicit library specification
extern function sqrt with x as Float returns Float from library "m"

# Unclear: Missing library (may not link correctly)
extern function sqrt with x as Float returns Float
```

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Print Debugging
```nlpl
extern function printf with format as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

printf("DEBUG: Variable x = %d\n", x)
printf("DEBUG: Pointer = %p\n", ptr)
```

### 2. Check NULL Pointers
```nlpl
if my_pointer is null
 printf("ERROR: Pointer is NULL!\n")
end
```

### 3. Validate Return Codes
```nlpl
set result to some_c_function()
printf("Function returned: %d\n", result)

if result is less than 0
 printf("ERROR: Function failed!\n")
end
```

---

## Advanced Features (Future)

### Callbacks (Planned)
```nlpl
# Pass NexusLang function to C library
function my_comparator with a as Integer with b as Integer returns Integer
 if a is less than b
 return -1
 else if a is greater than b
 return 1
 else
 return 0
 end
end

extern function qsort with base as Pointer with count as Integer with size as Integer with comparator as Pointer from library "c"

# Call with callback
qsort(array, 10, 8, address of my_comparator)
```

### Variadic Functions (Planned)
```nlpl
extern variadic function printf with format as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"

# Variable arguments
printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Score: %f\n", name, age, score)
```
