## Step 5: Publish Extension

### 5.1 Login with vsce

```bash
cd vscode-extension

# Login with your PAT
npx vsce login your-publisher-id

# When prompted, paste your PAT
# Press Enter
```

**Expected output:**
```
Personal Access Token for publisher 'your-publisher-id': ****
The Personal Access Token verification succeeded for the publisher 'your-publisher-id'.
```

### 5.2 Publish

```bash
# Publish current version
npx vsce publish

# Or publish with version bump
npx vsce publish patch  # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
npx vsce publish minor  # 0.1.0 → 0.2.0
npx vsce publish major  # 0.1.0 → 1.0.0
```

**Expected output:**
```
Publishing nlpl-team.nlpl-language-support@0.1.0...
Successfully published nlpl-team.nlpl-language-support@0.1.0!
Your extension will live at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nlpl-team.nlpl-language-support
```

### 5.3 Verify Publication

1. Visit marketplace URL from output
2. Check extension appears correctly
3. Verify all metadata (description, keywords, etc.)
4. Test installation:

```bash
code --install-extension nlpl-team.nlpl-language-support
```

---

## Step 6: Post-Publication

### 6.1 Update Documentation

Update `README.md` with marketplace installation:

```markdown
## Installation

### From Marketplace
```sh
code --install-extension nlpl-team.nlpl-language-support
```

Or search "NLPL" in VS Code Extensions view.
```

### 6.2 Tag Release

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Published to VS Code Marketplace"
git push origin v1.2.1
```

### 6.3 Create GitHub Release

1. Go to: https://github.com/Zajfan/NLPL/releases/new
2. Tag: `v1.2.1`
3. Title: `v1.2.1 - Marketplace Release`
4. Description: Link to marketplace
5. Attach: `nlpl-language-support-0.1.0.vsix`
6. Publish release

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Publisher not found"

**Solution**: Verify publisher ID in package.json matches exactly

### Error: "Extension name already taken"

**Solution**: Change extension name in package.json

### Error: "PAT expired"

**Solution**: Generate new PAT with same scopes

### Error: "Repository not found"

**Solution**: Ensure repository URL is public and accessible

### Warning: "Missing icon"

**Solution**: Add icon to package.json or use `--no-git-tag` flag:
```bash
npx vsce publish --no-git-tag
```

---

## Updating Published Extension

### Update Process

1. Make changes to extension
2. Update version in `package.json`
3. Rebuild: `npm run compile`
4. Test locally
5. Publish:

```bash
npx vsce publish patch  # Auto-increments version
```

### Version Strategy

- **Patch** (0.1.x): Bug fixes, minor updates
- **Minor** (0.x.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes

---

## Security Notes

### PAT Security

- **Never commit PAT to git**
- Store in secure location
- Rotate regularly (every 6-12 months)
- Use minimal required scopes

### Recommended: CI/CD

Set up automated publishing:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish-extension.yml
name: Publish Extension

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run compile
      - run: npx vsce publish -p ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
```

Store PAT as GitHub secret: `VSCE_PAT`
