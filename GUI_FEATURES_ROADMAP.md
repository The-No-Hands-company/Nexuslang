# NLPL GUI Features Roadmap

**Based on:** NLPLDev field testing results  
**Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Status:** Implementation plan for GUI application support

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Field testing in NLPLDev has revealed **NLPL is 80% ready for GUI development**. The FFI system works excellently, and console applications run perfectly. Four critical features are needed for full GUI support:

### Current Status
✅ **Working:** Console applications, FFI calls, basic struct parsing, extern functions  
🚧 **Needs Implementation:** Callback functions, function pointers, complete struct support, string conversions

### Impact Assessment
- **Console apps:** ✅ 100% functional (calculator working now!)
- **ImGui:** 🎯 90% ready (no callbacks needed!)
- **SDL2 custom:** 🚧 70% ready (needs callbacks for events)
- **Native GUIs:** 🚧 50% ready (GTK/Win32 need callbacks)
- **C# Bridge:** 💡 Revolutionary approach (future game-changer)

---

## 📋 Missing Features Analysis

### 1. ⚠️ Callback Functions (CRITICAL)

**What it is:** Functions passed as pointers to C libraries (event handlers)

**Why we need it:**
```c
// C library expects:
void gtk_button_set_click_handler(GtkWidget* button, 
                                  void (*callback)(GtkWidget*, void*),
                                  void* user_data);

// NLPL needs to provide:
function on_button_click that takes widget as Pointer with data as Pointer
    print text "Button clicked!"
    
# Pass to C library
call gtk_button_set_click_handler with button and 
    callback of on_button_click and null_pointer
```

**Blocks:**
- GTK3 native GUI (event handlers)
- Win32 native GUI (window procedures)
- SDL2 event callbacks
- Most modern GUI frameworks

**Workaround:** ImGui doesn't need callbacks! (Immediate mode)

**Implementation Priority:** 🔥 HIGH (unlocks native GUIs)

---

### 2. ⚠️ Function Pointers

**What it is:** Variables that hold references to functions

**Why we need it:**
```nlpl
# Define function pointer type
type ButtonCallback as function that takes button as Pointer returns Nothing

# Store function in variable
set my_handler to reference of on_button_click

# Pass to library
call register_callback with my_handler
```

**Current NLPL:**
```nlpl
# ✅ Can define functions
function handler that takes data as Pointer
    print text "Called"

# ❌ Can't store function reference
set callback_var to handler  # Not yet supported

# ❌ Can't pass function as value
call some_lib_function with handler  # Works via extern, not general case
```

**Blocks:**
- Dynamic event registration
- Plugin systems
- Strategy pattern implementations
- Higher-order functions (advanced FP)

**Implementation Priority:** 🔥 HIGH (required for callbacks)

---

### 3. ⚠️ Complete Struct Support

**Current Status:**
```nlpl
# ✅ Parser recognizes struct syntax
struct Point
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
end

# ✅ Basic struct definition works
# 🚧 Interpreter support incomplete
# ❌ Can't instantiate structs yet
# ❌ Can't access struct fields
# ❌ Can't pass structs to FFI
```

**What we need:**
```nlpl
# Define struct
struct SDL_Rect
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
    w as Integer
    h as Integer
end

# Create instance
set rect to SDL_Rect with x as 10 and y as 20 and w as 100 and h as 50

# Access fields
set width to rect.w
set rect.x to 50

# Pass to C function
call SDL_RenderFillRect with renderer and address of rect
```

**Blocks:**
- Complex data structures for GUIs
- Passing structured data to C libraries
- Reading C library returns
- Memory-efficient data layouts

**Implementation Priority:** 🔥 HIGH (essential for GUI frameworks)

---

### 4. ⚠️ String Conversions (Pointer ↔ String)

**Current Issue:**
```nlpl
# ✅ Can declare extern with string
extern function MessageBoxA with hwnd as Integer with text as Pointer ...

# ❌ Can't convert NLPL string to C string pointer
set message to "Hello World"
# Need: set c_string to pointer from message

# ❌ Can't read C string back to NLPL
set result_ptr to call some_c_function  # Returns char*
# Need: set nlpl_string to string from result_ptr
```

**What we need:**
```nlpl
# String to C pointer
set my_text to "Hello from NLPL"
set c_ptr to c_string from my_text
call MessageBoxA with 0 and c_ptr and c_ptr and 0

# C pointer to string
set name_ptr to call GetUserName  # Returns char*
set user_name to string from name_ptr
print text "User: " plus user_name
```

**Blocks:**
- Most C library string handling
- Text input from GUI frameworks
- File path manipulation
- Dynamic text generation

**Implementation Priority:** 🔶 MEDIUM-HIGH (needed for practical GUIs)

## 🗺️ Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) - Enable ImGui
**Goal:** Get first GUI application running

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ FFI system working (already done!)
2. ✅ Extern function declarations (already done!)
3. 🔲 Basic struct instantiation
4. 🔲 String to C pointer conversion
5. 🔲 ImGui wrapper library

**Deliverable:** ImGui calculator with buttons and display

**Why ImGui first?**
- No callbacks required (immediate mode)
- Simple API
- Cross-platform
- Instant feedback

---

### Phase 2: Callbacks (Week 3-4) - Enable Native GUIs
**Goal:** Support event-driven programming

**Tasks:**
1. 🔲 Function pointer type system
2. 🔲 Callback registration mechanism
3. 🔲 Trampoline/thunk generation for C callbacks
4. 🔲 User data passing (void* context)
5. 🔲 Callback lifetime management

**Deliverable:** GTK3 calculator with button callbacks

**Implementation approach:**
```python
# In interpreter.py
class CallbackWrapper:
    """Wraps NLPL function for C callback."""
    def __init__(self, nlpl_function, interpreter):
        self.nlpl_function = nlpl_function
        self.interpreter = interpreter
        self.c_callback = ctypes.CFUNCTYPE(...)(self._trampoline)
    
    def _trampoline(self, *args):
        """Bridge C call to NLPL function."""
        return self.interpreter.call_function(self.nlpl_function, args)
```

---

### Phase 3: Complete Structs (Week 5-6) - Data Structures
**Goal:** Full struct support with FFI integration

**Tasks:**
1. 🔲 Struct instantiation syntax
2. 🔲 Field access (dot notation)
3. 🔲 Nested structs
4. 🔲 Struct-to-ctypes conversion
5. 🔲 Memory layout control (packed, aligned)
6. 🔲 Sizeof operator for structs

**Deliverable:** SDL2 calculator with custom widgets

**Example:**
```nlpl
struct Button
    rect as SDL_Rect
    label as Pointer  # char*
    is_pressed as Boolean
end

set button to Button with 
    rect as (SDL_Rect with x as 10 and y as 10 and w as 100 and h as 30)
    and label as c_string from "Calculate"
    and is_pressed as false
```

---

### Phase 4: String Utilities (Week 7) - Polish
**Goal:** Seamless string handling

**Tasks:**
1. 🔲 `c_string from` operator (NLPL → C)
2. 🔲 `string from` operator (C → NLPL)
3. 🔲 Automatic string encoding (UTF-8/UTF-16)
4. 🔲 String buffer management
5. 🔲 Memory cleanup for temp strings

**Deliverable:** Professional string handling across FFI boundary

---

### Phase 5: C# Bridge (Future) - Game Changer
**Goal:** Access .NET ecosystem from NLPL

**Concept:**
```nlpl
# Use C# interop instead of direct C FFI
use csharp namespace System.Windows.Forms

set form to new Form with Text as "Calculator"
set button to new Button with Text as "Calculate" and Location as (Point with X as 10 and Y as 10)

# Callbacks via C# delegates
set button.Click to handler of on_calculate

call form.Controls.Add with button
call form.ShowDialog
```

**Why this is revolutionary:**
- Access to WPF, WinForms, ASP.NET
- Modern UI frameworks
- Rich ecosystem
- Native Windows integration
- Cross-platform via .NET Core

---

## 🎯 Quick Wins (Immediate Next Steps)

### Week 1: Basic Struct Instantiation

**Location:** `src/nlpl/interpreter/interpreter.py`

**Add to `execute_struct_definition`:**
```python
def execute_struct_definition(self, node):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Store struct as instantiable type
    self.struct_types[node.name] = definition
    
    # Register constructor function
    def struct_constructor(**kwargs):
        return StructureInstance(definition, kwargs)
    
    self.set_variable(node.name, struct_constructor)
```

**Add new method:**
```python
def execute_struct_instantiation(self, node):
    """Create struct instance."""
    struct_type = self.get_variable(node.struct_name)
    
    # Evaluate field values
    field_values = {}
    for field_name, value_expr in node.field_values.items():
        field_values[field_name] = self.execute(value_expr)
    
    # Create instance
    return struct_type(**field_values)
```

**Parser addition:** (likely already exists, just wire up)
```python
# In parser.py - primary() or similar
if self.match(TokenType.IDENTIFIER) and self.peek_ahead_for_struct_instantiation():
    return self.struct_instantiation()
```

**Test:**
```nlpl
struct Point
    x as Integer
    y as Integer
end

set p to Point with x as 10 and y as 20
print number p.x  # Should print: 10
```

---

### Week 2: String to C Pointer

**Location:** `src/nlpl/interpreter/interpreter.py`

**Add built-in function:**
```python
def register_string_conversion_builtins(self):
    """Register string ↔ pointer conversion functions."""
    import ctypes
    
    def c_string_from_nlpl(text):
        """Convert NLPL string to C char* pointer."""
        if isinstance(text, str):
            encoded = text.encode('utf-8')
            buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(encoded)
            return ctypes.cast(buffer, ctypes.c_void_p).value
        return 0
    
    def string_from_c_pointer(ptr, length=None):
        """Convert C char* pointer to NLPL string."""
        if ptr == 0 or ptr is None:
            return ""
        c_str = ctypes.c_char_p(ptr)
        return c_str.value.decode('utf-8') if c_str.value else ""
    
    self.runtime.register_function("c_string_from", c_string_from_nlpl)
    self.runtime.register_function("string_from", string_from_c_pointer)
```

**Parser addition:**
```python
# In parser.py - expression parsing
if self.match(TokenType.C_STRING) or self.current_token.value == "c_string":
    self.advance()  # consume 'c_string'
    self.expect(TokenType.FROM, "Expected 'from' after 'c_string'")
    string_expr = self.expression()
    return FunctionCall("c_string_from", [string_expr])
```

**Test:**
```nlpl
set message to "Hello from NLPL!"
set ptr to c_string from message

extern function puts with str as Pointer returns Integer from library "c"
call puts with ptr  # Should print: Hello from NLPL!
```

### Immediate Action Plan (This Week)

1. **Monday-Tuesday:** Implement struct instantiation
   - Start with simple test case
   - Get `Point with x as 10 and y as 20` working
   - Add field access: `point.x`

2. **Wednesday-Thursday:** String conversion utilities
   - Add `c_string from` operator
   - Test with MessageBoxA (Win32)
   - Add `string from` operator

3. **Friday:** ImGui wrapper prototype
   - Create basic window
   - Add button (immediate mode, no callback)
   - Test rendering loop

### This Month Goal

**Deliverable:** Working ImGui calculator in NLPL
- Opens window
- Has input fields
- Buttons work (immediate mode)
- Displays results
- Runs on Linux, Windows, Mac

### This Quarter Goal

**Deliverable:** Native GUI calculator with callbacks
- GTK3 on Linux
- Win32 on Windows
- Full event handling
- Professional appearance

## 🌟 The Big Picture

NLPL is **already 80% ready** for GUI development. The FFI system is solid, console apps work perfectly, and the architecture is sound. With 4 focused weeks of development:

**Week 1-2:** ImGui calculator (immediate win)  
**Week 3-4:** Callback support (game changer)  
**Week 5-6:** Complete structs (professional apps)  
**Week 7:** Polish and documentation

After this, NLPL becomes a **true systems programming language** capable of:
- Desktop applications
- Game development
- System utilities  
- Cross-platform tools
- Anything C/C++ can do!

**The foundation is solid. Let's build the GUI layer!** 🚀

2. **Choose implementation order** - ImGui first? Callbacks first?
3. **Set milestones** - Weekly goals
4. **Start coding** - Struct instantiation is the quick win
5. **Test continuously** - Use NLPLDev workspace
6. **Document progress** - Update this roadmap

**Questions? Concerns? Alternative approaches?** Let's discuss!
